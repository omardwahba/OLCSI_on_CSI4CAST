"""Time and datetime utilities for experiment management.

This module provides utilities for handling timestamps and datetime-based
file/directory operations commonly used in machine learning experiments:

- Standardized timestamp formatting for consistent naming
- Directory discovery based on datetime patterns
- Experiment run organization by timestamp

The module uses a consistent time format (YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS) across all
utilities to ensure proper sorting and identification of experiment runs.

# Standard time format used throughout the project for consistent timestamp formatting
# Format: YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS (e.g., "20250928_143022" for Sep 28, 2025 at 2:30:22 PM)

    Returns the current date and time as a formatted string using the
    project's standard time format. This is commonly used for creating
    unique identifiers for experiment runs, log files, and output directories.

    Returns:
        str: Current timestamp in format YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS

    Example:
        >>> timestamp = get_current_time()

    Searches through a parent directory for subdirectories that follow the
    project's standard datetime naming convention (YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS)

    This is useful for finding the latest experiment run or output directory
