"""Normalization utilities for complex CSI data processing.

This module provides comprehensive normalization functionality for Channel State Information (CSI)
data, which is inherently complex-valued. The normalization process is crucial for neural network
training stability and performance.

Key features:
- Separate normalization statistics for real and imaginary parts of complex data
- Persistent storage and loading of normalization statistics
- Support for both FDD (U2D) and TDD scenarios
- Batch processing with proper handling of complex tensor formats
- Denormalization for converting model outputs back to original scale

The normalization follows the standard z-score normalization: (x - mean) / std
but applied separately to real and imaginary components of complex CSI data.
