"""Utilities for converting between real and complex tensor representations.

This module provides functions to convert between different tensor formats used
for representing complex-valued data in neural networks:

1. Complex tensors: Native PyTorch complex tensors (torch.complex64/128)
2. Real flat tensors: Real tensors where complex data is represented as
   concatenated real and imaginary parts in the last dimension

These conversions are essential when working with models that don't natively
support complex operations, allowing complex CSI data to be processed using
real-valued neural network layers.

The module uses einops for efficient tensor rearrangement operations.

def real_flat_to_complex(x: torch.Tensor) -> torch.Tensor:
    """Convert a flat real tensor representation to complex tensor format.

    Takes a real tensor where complex values are represented as concatenated
    real and imaginary parts in the last dimension, and converts it to a
    proper complex tensor. This is useful when working with models that
    output real tensors but represent complex data.

    The conversion assumes the last dimension contains pairs of (real, imaginary)
    values, so the dimension size must be even.

    Returns:
        torch.Tensor: Complex tensor of shape [B, L, K] where each element
                     is a complex number formed from consecutive real/imaginary pairs
