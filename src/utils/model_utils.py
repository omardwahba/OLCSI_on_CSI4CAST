"""Model utility functions for loading and managing PyTorch Lightning models.

This module provides utilities for:
- Loading models from checkpoints or configuration
- Finding the best checkpoint based on validation loss
- Managing model initialization and device placement

The utilities support both checkpoint-based loading (for inference or continued training)
and fresh initialization (for new training runs).
